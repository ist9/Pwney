Meet the Pwney! The Extremely basic but cute wordlist generator.

As i mentioned above Pwney is a extremely basic but cute and open source wordlist generator which saves them into .txt file. Pwney can create passwords with special needs such as uppercase only.There is nothing more to say... Really he is that simple.

How to use?

Pwney needs 3 things to work:
   - A name for the save file
   - Amount of passwords you want to create
   - Length of each password
     
Usage: 
python pwney.py -f/--filename file_name -a/--amount pwd_amount -p/--pwdlength pwd_length

Example Usage:
python pwney.py -f mywordlist -a 2 -p 5

Example Output:


Pwney has got 4 options for you to choose. If you choose an option password will be generated based on only the options you specified. If non is given, Pwney will create his passwords as all options are enabled.

     -u/--upper = Enable Uppercase
     -l/--lower = Enable Lowercase
     -s/--special = Enable Special Characters
     -n/--numbers = Enable Numbers

And yea, this is Pwney. Just like I said "extremely basic". I believe Pwney will improve himself overtime by the helps of his family(which is you guys) and the person who found him stranded in the forest!






Shame on the person who left him stranded!
